# Lesson 2

# Classes and Objects

'''A class is a description of a type of data structure made up of other data structures.
The two primary parts that make up a class are:
-Attributes -> A variable or fixed value
-Methods -> A function'''

class Car:
      def init(self, wheel, engine, door, window, gastank, colour):
      	  self.wheel = wheel    # number of wheels
          self.engine = engine    # type of engine
          self.door = door    # number of doors
          self.window = window    # number of windows
          self.gas = gastank   # amount of fuel in car
          self.color = color   # color of car

'''A "Class" is like a blueprint - it tells you how to make something.  An "Object" is the thing that gets made'''

myCar = Car(4, True, 4, 4, 'Full', 'Green)

# myCar is a created object from the class Car

#### EVERYTHING IN PYTHON IS AN OBJECT!  ####
# Which is why this is important ;)

# For example, the "string" data type":

#"the dog" "is black"
#"the dog"+"is black"
#=? the dogis black 
#=? the do(g)+(i)s black

greetings = "Hello, I am com-pu-tor"
